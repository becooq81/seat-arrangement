# 🎉 Seating Arrangement Web App

I created this website in order to facilitate random seat assignment @ SSAFY 12th. Email me (becooq81@gmail.com) for any feedback or inquiries. Enjoy! 😊

## Overview

This web application helps to arrange students into pairs or triplets and display their seating arrangement in a grid format. It includes features for inputting student names, shuffling them into groups, and displaying the results with pairs/triplets colored in pastel. ✨

## Live Demo

You can access the live version of the app [here](https://github.com/becooq81/seat-arrangement.git). Feel free to try it out and see how it works! 🚀

## Features

- ✍️ **Input Management**: Easily add, edit, or remove pairs and triplets of student names using text inputs or a textarea. This feature allows you to input groups of names separated by line breaks, commas, or whitespace.
- 🔄 **Shuffling**: Randomly shuffle student groups to ensure a varied seating arrangement.
-  📏 **Customizable Grid**: Adjust the grid dimensions for seating arrangement (default is 4 rows by 6 columns).
- 📋 **Textarea Input**: Input student names in bulk using a textarea where groups are divided by line breaks and names within groups are separated by commas or whitespace. This method simplifies bulk entry and management of student names.
